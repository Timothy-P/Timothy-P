I'm Timothy-P. I've been making HTML, CSS, and JS projects for a minute now. I haven't been doing it as long as a ton of people, but I'm doing good with my work.
I've finished many projects, but I just haven't put them on GitHub. I also have a lot of prototypes but they aren't complete by any means and are just for notes and such.
I do have Discord, so please don't hesitate to bother me there. I also need sponsors so I can continue making stuff because I can't buy stuff. If anyone is willing to sponsor me, please do. It'll be below this line. And, have a good day, you deserve it if you've been a good human today.
