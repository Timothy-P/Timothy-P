I'm Timothy-P. I've been making HTML, CSS, and JS projects for a minute. I haven't been doing it as long as a ton of people, but I'm doing good with my work.
I've finished many projects but haven't put them on GitHub. I also have a lot of prototypes but they aren't complete by any means and are just for notes and such.
I previously used Discord (Still technically there, I don't use it) but left because I got tired of rude people. I also need sponsors to continue making stuff because I can't buy stuff. If anyone is willing to sponsor me, please do. It'll be below this line. And, have a good day, you deserve it if you've been a good human today.
