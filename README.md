I'm Timothy-P. I've been making HTML, CSS, and JS projects for a minute. I haven't been doing it as long as a ton of people, but I'm doing good with my work.
I've finished many projects but haven't put them on GitHub. I also have a lot of prototypes but they aren't complete by any means and are just for notes and such.
I also need sponsors to continue making stuff because I can't buy stuff. If anyone is willing to sponsor me, please do. It'll be below this line. And, have a good day, you deserve it if you've been a good human today.

However, if you don't know what to do to get one of the projects working, I'll provide steps below.

1. Download the zip. Click on the green button (when on one of the repositories) to download the whole thing.
2. Extract the files. On Windows, you should be able to right-click the zip and select "extract all" from the context menu.
3. Double click on the file named "index.html". It might be different if you go back a few months, as it made it simpler while orginizing my files.
4. Enjoy. Some are more fun or useful than others. If you find an issue, let me know. I would like to improve whenever possible.
