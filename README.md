I'm Timothy-P. I've been making HTML, CSS, and JS projects for a minute now. I haven't been doing it as long as a ton of people, but I think I'm doing good with my work.
I've got a lot of projects finished, but I just haven't put them on GitHub. I also have a lot of prototypes but they aren't complete by any means and are just for notes and such.
I do have Discord, so you can bother me there. It'll be below this line. And, have a good day, you deserve it if you've been a good human today.
